# NZPI Dashboard

The NZPI dashboard will be used to help inform conservation groups about the breeding success of the Korōrā and help to identify any potential issues that may be occurring.

The NZPI dashboard is an app written in RShiny. It has a secure login system and a guest mode. Currently it has 4 sections: summaries, comparisons, nest checks, and visualise own data. Each section has a set of filters and a plot or table. The data is loaded from a database and is filtered based on the user's access level. The user can also upload their own data and visualise it.
